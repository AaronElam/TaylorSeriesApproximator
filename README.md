## More detailed description
This program uses Taylor polynomials to estimate values of the base-e exponential, sine, and cosine functions for inputs in the interval [−5, 5].
The calculator allows the user to select a function (either e^x, sin x, or cos x and a real value of x from the interval [−5, 5], and should return the correct value of the function at the selected value of x, accurate to at least eight decimal places.
